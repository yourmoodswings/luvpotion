      narrative: `Prime Minister of Nigeria, 1957–1966 In the heat of a desert storm, our first Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, rides against the winds of an uncertain nation. A symbol of dignity and humility, he clutches Nigeria’s newborn destiny—two white horses, fierce and untamed, tethered to a coat of arms still learning its weight. In his other hand, an eagle perches with the promise of pride, but its wings are restless. This is no ordinary ride—it is a metaphor for a foundation not yet solid. Nigeria, freshly carved and already cracking under the pressure of ambition, expectation, and division, placed its hopes in Balewa’s calm hands. From 1957 until his tragic assassination in 1966, he steered a fragile federation with quiet conviction, threading unity through a rising tide of regionalism and unrest. But the storm was faster than resolve, and louder than the silent patience he carried. He was taken from us in the midst of a riddle we are still trying to solve. What did he die for? This piece does not offer an answer—it mourns the question. Through this painting, we immortalize a man who bore the weight of a fragmented future too soon. It is not just history—it is a haunting reflection of what it means to lead a nation still finding its voice, and a reminder of the price of carrying it alone.`
